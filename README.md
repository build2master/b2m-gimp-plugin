All sorts of useful plugin for GIMP written by Build-2-Master

## Installing plugins
The installation is simple. Just down this repository as a ZIP file. Unpack it and copy the Python file that you need into the folder:

	~/.gimp-{version_num}/plug-ins/  (for Linux)


On Windows or other OS, please follow the instructions in this link:
